How to experience traditional Slovak culture in Liptov
======================================================
Liptov is one of the best areas to experience traditional culture in Slovakia, but you still need to know where to go for the best possible experience. We have tried compiling the best possible list for you.

1\. UNESCO Heritage site **Vlkolinec**
==============================================

> Nestled in the hillside of the Veľká Fatra just outside the town of Ružomberok, the tiny mountain hamlet of Vlkolínec feels like a village completely frozen in time. [...] It feels like you’ve walked on to a set from The Lord of The Rings or have somehow been transported back in time.

4\. Go to the supermarket and find **Brynzda**, **smoked cheeses** and more
==============================================
As counterintuitive as it might seem, the best place to experience truly authentic culture is often to go to the supermarket and find the stuff people actually eat.
Look for **Brynzda**, a young Slovak goat cheese, or **Korbáčik**, a string cheese made from sheep milk. Of course you can also find these in countless of shops dedicated to tourists, but sometimes just taking the time to find them in the supermarket can be a lot easier. Also make sure to take a good look at the pastries and
find Slovak delights such as **Makovník**, **Orechovník** or **Medovníky**.

5\. Wooden Articular Church of **Svaty Kriz**
=============================================
Wooden Articular Church of **Svaty Kriz** is one of the biggest entirely wooden structures in Europe. In the 17th century protestant churches in the then Kingdom of Hungary (now Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Transylvania) were prohibited from using stones in construction, required to be build outside of cities and villages, without bells and proper towers and facing away from roads. On top of that this entire church was moved between 1974 1982 from it's original location when a new dam was built.

6\. Slovak museum of nature protection and speleology
=====================================================
> With a wet afternoon to pass, we were up for pretty much anything. But this museum is up there with the very best. Very modern, interactive displays. Factual and thought provoking [...] Well worth a trip in its own right.

An amazingly modern museum about Slovak history with a focus on nature and a section dedicated to speleology. Everything has been translated in English and one can easily spend a couple of hours here.
