4\. Go to the supermarket and find **Brynzda**, **smoked cheeses** and more
==============================================
As counterintuitive as it might seem, the best place to experience truly authentic culture is often to go to the supermarket and find the stuff people actually eat.
Look for **Brynzda**, a young Slovak goat cheese, or **Korbáčik**, a string cheese made from sheep milk. Of course you can also find these in countless of shops dedicated to tourists, but sometimes just taking the time to find them in the supermarket can be a lot easier. Also make sure to take a good look at the pastries and
find Slovak delights such as **Makovník**, **Orechovník** or **Medovníky**.
