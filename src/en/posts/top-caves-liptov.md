1\. Demänovská Cave of Liberty
==============================================
Demänovská Cave of Liberty is the most visited cave in Slovakia which has been open to the public for nearly 100 years. It's a well managed cave ideal to visit with children and the unique dripstone ornamentation rank it as one of the most beatiful caves in Europe. If you come to visit you can pick from two different tours, the shorter one is 1150 meters long (1 hour) and the longer 2150 meters long (100 minutes).

2\. Demänovská Ice Cave
==============================================
On the right side of the Demänovská valley below the northern slopes of the low tatras another cave is open to the public: Demänovská ľadová jaskyňa. The ice filling the cave year round is over 500 year old and beatiful to behold. Do make sure to bring a good jacket in summer though.

3\. Cave of the dead bats
==============================================
The cave of the dead bats - or Jaskyňa mŕtvych netopierov in slovak - is a less commercial and man touched cave where you're more likely to find locals than tourists. It gets it's name from the countless bat bones found in the cave. To get there you need to climb up a hill and even the basic tour requires a harness for safety reasons. Additionally they also offer [two spelunking routes](/img/surroundings/jaskyna-mrtvych-netopierov.jpg) which - given you're physically fit - are absolutely worth experiencing.
