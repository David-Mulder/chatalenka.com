1\. Go **hiking** in the Slovak mountains
===========
Slovakia is a hiker's paradise and best of all it's "off-the-beaten-track" enough that the people you encounter will be locals. Whether you want to 
lose yourself in nature for a couple of days or go on an easy hike with children, there are options for everyone. 

The most famous mountain range in Slovakia - also featured on the country's official shield - are the Tatra mountains which make up the highest mountain range of the Carpathian Mountains with 29 peaks higher than 2 500 metres. They are divided in several parts, the north you have the High Tatras containing the highest point Gerlachovský štít at 2 655 metres and the country's highly symbolic mountain Kriváň. To the west are the Western Tatras and separated from the Tatras proper by the valley of the Váh river are the Low Tatras. 

Chata Lenka is located in the Liptov Region which lies in the aforementioned valley.

===========
