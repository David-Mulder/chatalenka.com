===========
Slovakia is a hiker's paradise and best of all it's "off-the-beaten-track" enough that the people you encounter will be locals. Whether you want to 
lose yourself in nature for a couple of days or peacefully hike with children, there are options for everyone.

The Liptov Area is surrounded on all side by mountains.
