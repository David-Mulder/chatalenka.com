Top things to do in **Hrabovo, Ruzomberok** in summer

1\. Go for a **swim** or simply **relax** near the water
====================================================
Chilling near the waterside might not be the fanciest or most unique thing in the world, but it definitely can be one of the most relaxing things.
Enjoy the water, the sun and the ambience.

2\. Take the gondola lift to **Malino Brdo**
============================================
There is a gondola lift taking you straight to Malino Brdo, allowing for a relaxing and calm walk back down.

3\. And hike to **Vlkolinec**
===================
Once you took the Gondola Lift to Malino Brdo it's just a short half an hour hike to get to Vlkolinec, a historic village granted  UNESCO World Heritage site
status in 1993. It is the regionâ€™s most complete group of these kinds of traditional log houses, often found in mountainous areas.

Alternatively you can also get to Vlkolinec in a couple of hours hike up the ridge of Hyrova hill up to the amazing view from Sidorove (1099m) and then walk down to Vlkolinec. Just make sure to bring enough water.

4\. Or take a **mountain scooter** back down
============================================
Need to get back to your accomodation in Hrabovo? Walking or taking the Gondola lift are relaxing options, but you can also rent a mountain scooter in 
Malino Brdo and a guide will take you back down to the start of the gondola lift. It's a fun experience and definitely worth it!

5\. Or bring a bike and enjoy **bikepark Malino Brdo**
