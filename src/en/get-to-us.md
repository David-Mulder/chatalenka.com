How to get to us? 
===================================
Despite being the heart of Europe, Slovakia and Liptov are "off-the-beaten-track" and thus getting there can be harder than the more tourist and Chinese filled tourist destinations.

From the United Kingdom
=======================
Wizz Air runs flights from London Luton to Poprad airport 3 times per week. If you rent a car in Poprad it's [just a 50 minute drive](https://goo.gl/maps/y6Ltj66qXy8Ms1NV9) to Chata Lenka. 

From Germany
============
In general the best option from Germany is to drive by car. Depending on where you're leaving from you will drive through the Czech Republic or Poland, given a choice
(e.g. from the Ruhr area or the Netherlands) we would recommend the route through Poland.

From Poland
===========
In general the best option from Poland is to drive by car.

From Israel
